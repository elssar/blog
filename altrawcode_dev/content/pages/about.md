Hi, I'm Akshay, a curious computer programmer interested in computers (duh!), technology, sci-fi/fantasy, video games, sports and a few other things. Up until a few months ago I was working at [Postman](https://postman.com), but I decided to take some time off, to recharge and and to learn and experiment. I have instead spent the last few months alternating between trying to finish {STREAMING_PLATFORM} and furiously reading. Welcome to my website :)

Mostly harmless.
